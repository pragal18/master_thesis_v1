It became the Spanish branch of EADS in 1999, and was absorbed by Airbus Military in 2009.\n\nHistory\nCASA has been a part of EADS, the European aerospace corporation, with Aérospatiale-Matra of France, Dornier GmbH and DASA of Germany since 1999. From then, the Spanish branch of EADS is called EADS-CASA. The current CEO and Chairman of EADS-CASA is Domingo Ureña-Raso. EADS-CASA currently employs around 7,500 workers. EADS was formed in July, 2000 following the merger of Aerospatiale Matra of France, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany and Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. from Spain. It is the third largest aerospace company in the world with approximately 100,000 employees. In July 2001 EADS-CASA Military Aircraft marked the beginning of the Eurofighter Typhoon Final Assembly Phase at Getafe. It is one of four assembly lines for the Eurofighter (the other three are at Warton in the United Kingdom, Manching in Germany and Turin in Italy). Production was expected to be up to seven Typhoon wings per month and 12 aircraft per year. EADS CASA is producing the right wing for the Eurofighter and assembling 87 aircraft for the Spanish Air Force. First delivery was realized together with the other partner air forces in the second half of 2002.\n\nMilitary Transport Aircraft Division\nEADS CASA’s Military Transport Aircraft Division (MTAD) was based in Madrid. One of the aircraft it produces is the Airbus A330-200, which has been modified to provide air-to-air refuelling. It has provided one variant to the Royal Australian Air Force and another to the UK's Royal Air Force via the AirTanker company. MTAD's main focus is in the light to medium end of the military transport market covering three to nine tonnes. The MTAD managed the industrial and technical activities of participating companies for the A400M project. This responsibility is now managed by Airbus Military.\n\nProducts\n\n*  CASA C-212 Aviocar \n*  CASA/IPTN CN-235 regional airliner and military transport. \n*  EADS CASA HC-144 Ocean Sentry \n*  CASA C-295 regional airliner and military transport. \n*  Eurofighter Typhoon\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\n*  EADS-CASA official site" .

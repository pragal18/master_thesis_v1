It is the opposite direction from west.\n\nEtymology\nThe word east comes from Middle English est, from Old English ēast, which itself comes from the Proto-Germanic *aus-to- or *austra- \"east, toward the sunrise\", from Proto-Indo-European *aus- \"to shine,\" or \"dawn\". This is similar to Old High German *ōstar \"to the east\", Latin aurora \"dawn\", and Greek ēōs or heōs. Ēostre, a Germanic goddess of dawn, might have been a personification of both dawn and the cardinal points.\n\nNavigation\nBy convention, the right hand side of a map is east. This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north at the top. To go east using a compass for navigation, set a bearing or azimuth of 90°.\n\nCultural\nEast is the direction toward which the Earth rotates about its axis, and therefore the general direction from which the Sun appears to rise. The practice of praying towards the East is older than Christianity, but has been adopted by this religion as the Orient was thought of as containing mankind's original home. Hence, most Christian churches are oriented towards the east.\n\nSee also\n\n* Easting \n* Oriental\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n*  16x16px The dictionary definition of east at Wiktionary" .

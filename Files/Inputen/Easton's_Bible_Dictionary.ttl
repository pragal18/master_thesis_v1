The first edition was published in 1893 and a revised edition was published the following year. The most popular edition, however, was the third, which was published by Thomas Nelson in 1897, three years after Easton's death. The last contains nearly 4,000 entries relating to the Bible from a 19th-century perspective. Many of the entries in Easton's are encyclopedic in nature, although there are also short dictionary-type entries. Because of its age, it is now a public domain resource.\n\nSee also\n\n* Bauer lexicon \n* Smith's Bible Dictionary, another popular 19th century Bible dictionary\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n*  Easton, Matthew George, ed.
